<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffa400;">2. Answer the following questions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">a. What is the difference between mass and
weight of an object. Will the mass and
weight of an object on the earth be same
as their values on Mars? Why?</h4><div>Answer::</div><div><p>&nbsp; Mass is the amount of matter present in an organism while weight of an object is mass along with gravitational force I. e. W=Mg.</p><p>&nbsp;Mass of an object will be same at any point of the universe but its weight depends on the amount of gravity present on that planet thus mass of object on Mars will be same but weight will be different.

<span style="color: red;">{*this question can come for 2 marks in exam *}</span></p><p><br /></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">b. What are (i) free fall, (ii) acceleration
due to gravity (iii) escape velocity (iv)
centripetal force ?&nbsp;</h4></div><div>Answer::</div><div><br />
<h4 style="text-align: left;">(i)&nbsp;<strong><u>Free Fall</u>:</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Whenever an object moves under the influence of the force of gravity alone, it is said to be in Free Fall. During&nbsp;free fall initial velocity of an object is zero&nbsp;and force of air also acts on an object. Thus real free fall is possible only in a vacuum because there is no air.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>(ii) Acceleration due to gravity:</strong></h4>

<p>The earth exerts gravitational force on objects near it. According to Newton’s second law of motion, a force acting on a body results in its acceleration. Thus, the gravitational force due to the earth on a body results in its acceleration. This is called acceleration due to gravity and is denoted by ‘g’.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>(iii) Escape velocity:&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>The minimum value of the initial velocity at which an object to escape from the gravitational pull of the earth and never comes back to the earth is called the escape velocity.</p>

<p>Formula&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(V_{esc}=\sqrt 
{ \tfrac{2GM}{R}}\)</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>(iv)&nbsp;Centripetal force:&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>The force that acts on an object to keep it moving along the circular path with constant speed is called the centripetal force.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its formula is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(F_c=\tfrac{mv^2}{r}\)</span></p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span class="math-tex">c. Write the three laws given by Kepler.
How did they help Newton to arrive at the
inverse square law of gravity?</span></h4><div><span class="math-tex">Answer::</span></div><div><span class="math-tex"><h3>Kepler's first law:</h3><p>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci.</p><h3>Kepler's Second law:</h3><p>The line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time</p><h3>Kepler's Third law :</h3><p>The square of its period of revolution around the Sun is directly proportional to the cube of the mean distance of a planet from the Sun.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">d. A stone thrown vertically upwards with
initial velocity u reaches a height ‘h’
before coming down. Show that the
time taken to go up is same as the time
taken to come down.</h3><div><br /></div></span></div>
